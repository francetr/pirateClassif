This file describe how you can incorporate the classification script onto PiRATE
To do it there are several files that you need to respect an architecture in the VM. You first need to put the directory containing the source code (pirateClassif) into the directory /home/jeremy/galaxy/tools/Pipeline/
At least repositories MCL and classification and file classification.xml (used to add a classification panel onto the galaxy tools panel) need to be in it.

This repository (integration_galaxy) contains:
 - integrated_tool_panel.xml (located in /home/jeremy/galaxy) : used to specify how to integrate the tools onto galaxy
 - tool_conf.xml (located in /home/jeremy/galaxy/config) : configuration of each tool

NB :
You also need to copy/paste the whole repository containing the classification scripts (must be named as classification) in the repository classification that you have created in /home/jeremy/galaxy/tools/Pipeline/
To summarize, the source code of classification is onto the repository /home/jeremy/galaxy/tools/Pipeline/pirateClassif
